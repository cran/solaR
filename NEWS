solaR 0.22
==========
* The calculation of the sunset time has been improved.
* The voltage dependency of the efficiency curve of the inverter
  is now included in fProd and calcGCPV.
* The default values of the module, generator
  and inverter of both fProd, calcGCPV and
  optimShd are now documented.
* The help page of optimShd now explains correctly the concept of GRR.
* The plot method for Shade has been renamed to shadeplot.
* The as.data.frame method of the Shade class is
  now exported.
* The example included in the Target diagram help page
  now includes a graphic using the function horizonplot of latticeExtra.
* Several bugs have been corrected.

solaR 0.21
==========

solaR is now able to calculate from both daily and sub-daily irradiation values. These are the
most important changes:

* calcSol and fSolI gain a "BTi" argument for intradaily time bases.
* fCompI gains a "G0I" argument for intradaily irradiation series.
* fCompI gains both "corr" and "f" arguments.
* calcG0, calcGef, prodGCPV and prodPVPS gain a new "bdI" argument for intradaily irradiation, 
and the "corr", "f" arguments.
* The "bd" (and the new "bdI") argument of "calcG0" can be now a "Meteo" object. 
The "file" component of this argument can be now a "zoo" object.
* New methods ("losses", "compareLosses" and "compare") are available for "Gef" and "ProdGCPV" classes.
* The "corr" argument of "fCompD" (and "fCompI") can be now "corr=none".
* The correlations between the diffuse fraction and the clearness index are now 
coded outside "fCompD" as separate functions. 
Several new correlations have been included, both for monthly/daily values and for intradaily values.
* New small functions for difftime objects have been included.
* Small bugs have been fixed.

solaR 0.20
==========

* The package is now almost entirely designed with S4 classes and methods.
* The time series object are constructed with the 'zoo' package.
* Most of the functions and arguments have been renamed in order to 
ease the understanding by international users.
* Two new functions have been included for the statistical analysis of a PV plant composed of several systems.
* The package dependencies have been optimized.
* Several new small functions for date-time calculations are now available.
* Several bugs have been corrected.
